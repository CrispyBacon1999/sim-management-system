# Sim-Management-System

Created for the FIRST in Michigan FRC Unofficial Discord States.

Runs with the [FRC Simulator](http://ftcsimulator.org/).

## Setup

1. Install nodejs
2. Run `npm i` in the base project directory
3. Run `npm run dev`

Currently expects the file output for the simulator to be in C:/FRC.
Just run `/SET OUTPUT_SCORE_FILES=C:/FRC` as a spectator account in the chat.

### Todo:

- [ ] Config for file output location
